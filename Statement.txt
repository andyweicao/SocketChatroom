I design a GUI to show all the outputs and commands.

First, run the Server file and we can see the sentence "The server is running."
Then, run the Client file and a window comes out.
      a. Enter IP Address of the Server (Check the IP address.) 
      b. Choose a username from the Appendix
      c. Enter the according password from the Appendix.

Server will have a welcome message and we can enter commands in the top text input bar.

You can run Client file again to repeat all the client processes to connect another client to the server. Then clients can see each other.
